    <h2>Description</h2>

    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>4 lemons, halved</li>
      <li>2 medium sweet onions, quartered</li>
      <li>
        4 serrano chiles, split in 1/2 lengthwise and seeds and membranes
        removed
      </li>
      <li>2 heads garlic, peeled and halved</li>
      <li>2 bunches fresh thyme, tied with string</li>
      <li>1 ⅔ cups seafood seasoning (such as Old Bay®), or more to taste</li>
      <li>6 teaspoons kosher salt, or more to taste</li>
      <li>6 bay leaves</li>
      <li>3 pounds medium red potatoes, cut in 1/2</li>
      <li>
        5 (13 ounce) packages smoked kielbasa sausage, cut into 2-inch pieces
      </li>
      <li>6 ears sweet corn, halved</li>
      <li>30 littleneck clams, scrubbed</li>
      <li>4 pounds jumbo shrimp, deveined, tail on</li>
      <li>2 ½ pounds Alaskan king crab legs</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Fill a very large stockpot fitted with a basket insert with about 8
        quarts of water, or about halfway full. Squeeze lemons into the water,
        tossing the halves in too. Add onions, chiles, garlic, thyme, seafood
        seasoning, kosher salt, and bay leaves; bring to a boil over medium-high
        heat. Reduce heat and simmer for 10 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>Stir potatoes into the pot and simmer for 15 to 20 minutes.</li>
      <li>
        Next, add sausage and corn; cook another 5 minutes, making sure
        everything stays covered with the liquid.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add clams and boil until they open, about 8 minutes. Toss in shrimp and
        shut off the heat. Cover the pot and let shrimp steep in the flavor for
        10 minutes, adding crab in the last 5 minutes (press them into the
        liquid).
      </li>
      <li>
        Drain and spread crab, shrimp, sausage, clams, corn, potatoes, and
        onions out on a newspaper-covered table or on three large serving trays.
        Sprinkle with a dusting of Old Bay or provide for individual use.
      </li>
    </ol>
